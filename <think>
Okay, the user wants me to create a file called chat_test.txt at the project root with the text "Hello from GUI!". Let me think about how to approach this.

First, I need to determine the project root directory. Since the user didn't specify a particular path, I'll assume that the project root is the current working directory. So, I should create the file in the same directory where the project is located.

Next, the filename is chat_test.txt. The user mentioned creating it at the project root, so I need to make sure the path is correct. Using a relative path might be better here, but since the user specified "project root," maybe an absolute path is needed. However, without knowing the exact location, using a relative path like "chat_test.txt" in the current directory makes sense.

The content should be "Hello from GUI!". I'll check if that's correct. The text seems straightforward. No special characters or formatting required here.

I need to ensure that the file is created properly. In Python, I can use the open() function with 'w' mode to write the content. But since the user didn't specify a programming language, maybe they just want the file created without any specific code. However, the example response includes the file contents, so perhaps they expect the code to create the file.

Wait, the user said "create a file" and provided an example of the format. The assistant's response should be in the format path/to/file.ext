<file contents>. So the path would be something like "chat_test.txt" assuming it's in the current directory. But since the user mentioned project root, maybe the path is "./chat_test.txt". However, without knowing the exact location, using a relative path is safer.

Alternatively, if the project root is the current directory, then the path is just "chat_test.txt". But to be precise, using "./chat_test.txt" might be better. Let me confirm: in the example response, the assistant used "path/to/file.ext:::<file contents>", so if the file is in the project root, the path would be "chat_test.txt".

So putting it all together, the correct format would be:

chat_test.txt::Hello from GUI!

But I need to make sure that the path is accurate. Since the user said "project root," maybe the path is "./chat_test.txt". However, without knowing the exact location, using a relative path is acceptable. The assistant's previous response used a relative path, so following that example, it would be "chat_test.txt::Hello from GUI!".

Yes, that makes sense. So the final answer is:

chat_test.txt::Hello from GUI!
</think>

chat_test.txt::Hello from GUI!
